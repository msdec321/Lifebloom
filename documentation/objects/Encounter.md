### characterRankings
**Type:** JSON

Player rankings information for a zone. This data is not considered frozen, and it can change without notice. Use at your own risk.

**Arguments:**
- `bracket` (Int) - Optional. A specific bracket (e.g., item level range) to use instead of overall rankings. For WoW, brackets are item levels or keystones. For FF, brackets are patches.
- `difficulty` (Int) - Optional. A specific difficulty to fetch rankings for. If omitted, the highest difficulty is used.
- `filter` (String) - Optional. A filter string for advanced searching. The syntax matches the one used on the web site exactly, so you can filter encounter rankings on the site to figure out the string to use.
- `page` (Int) - Optional. Which page of rankings to fetch. By default the first page is used.
- `partition` (Int) - Optional. Whether or not to filter the rankings to a specific partition. By default, the latest partition is chosen.
- `serverRegion` (String) - Optional. The short name of a region to filter to. If paired with a server slug, will uniquely identify a server. If used by itself, rankings for that specific region will be fetched.
- `serverSlug` (String) - Optional. The slug for a specific server. Whether or not to filter rankings to a specific server. If omitted, data for all servers will be used.
- `size` (Int) - Optional. Whether or not to filter rankings to a specific size. If omitted, the first valid raid size will be used.
- `leaderboard` (LeaderboardRank) - Optional. Controls whether to include ranks without backing logs in games & content types that support this. Ignored if unsupported.
- `hardModeLevel` (HardModeLevelRankFilter) - Optional. Filters ranks to a specific hard mode (0-5) or any hard mode level (-1). Most encounters do not have variable hard mode levels. Use `difficulty` for ESO Veteran Hard Modes.
- `metric` (CharacterRankingMetricType) - Optional. You can filter to a specific player metric like dps or hps. If omitted, an appropriate default player metric for the zone will be chosen.
- `includeCombatantInfo` (Boolean) - Optional. Whether or not to include detailed combatant info such as gear in the results.
- `className` (String) - Optional. The slug for a specific class. Whether or not to filter rankings to a specific class. If omitted, data for all classes will be used.
- `specName` (String) - Optional. The slug for a specific spec. Whether or not to filter rankings to a specific spec. If omitted, data for all specs will be used.
- `externalBuffs` (ExternalBuffRankFilter) - Optional. Controls whether to include ranks with/without external buffs. Most games and zones do not support this filter and will quietly ignore it.
- `covenantID` (Int) - Optional. The covenant ID to filter to if viewing Shadowlands rankings.
- `soulbindID` (Int) - Optional. The soulbind ID to filter to if viewing Shadowlands rankings.
